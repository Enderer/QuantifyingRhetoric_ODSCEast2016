## Preparation
You will need:
* Python 3
* nltk
* pandas

We recommend just downloading Anaconda 3, or trying out our handy VM, Merlin (see more below).

From the Python interactive prompt, call nltk.download() and select the corpus for download.

Once you have an environment set up, you should also clone this repository into the environment.

### Project Merlin (http://bit.ly/merlin-vm)
Data Science is difficult enough without having to worry about installing and configuring a variety of open source tools. Project Merlin solves this problem by providing you with a computing environment that comes with all the latest data science tools pre-installed and configured. We've also included popular big data tools so that you can experiment with them without having to learn how to administer them. Project Merlin is currently in an alpha state.  We are happy to receive your feedback at ccds@bah.com.
